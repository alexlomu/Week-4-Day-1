#Import all the necessary libraries here:

#Import the Fitbit2 dataset and store it in a variable called fitbit. You can find the dataset in Ironhack's database:

#How the average number of steps change by month. Use the appropriate visualization to show the median steps by month. Is Fitbitter more active on weekend or workdays? 

#Write a loop to plot 3 scatter plots of the following features:

#Import the titanic dataset and store it in a variable called titanic. You can find the dataset in Ironhack's database:

#Explore the titanic dataset using Pandas dtypes.

#What are your numerical variables? What are your categorical variables?

#Set the plot style to classic and the figure size to (12,6).

#Use the right visulalization to show the distribution of column Age.

#Use subplots and plot the distribution of the Age with bins equal to 10, 20 and 50.

#How does the bin size affect your plot?


#Use seaborn to show the distribution of column Age.

#Use the right plot to visualize column Gender. There are 2 ways of doing it. Do it both ways.

#Use the right plot to visualize the column Pclass.

#We would like to have in one single plot the summary statistics of the feature Age. What kind of plot would you use? Plot it.

#What does the last plot tell you about the feature Age?

#Now in addition to the summary statistics, we want to have in the same plot the distribution of Age. What kind of plot would you use? Plot it.

#What additional information does the last plot provide about feature Age?

#We suspect that there is a linear relationship between Fare and Age. Use the right plot to show the relationship between these 2 features. There are 2 ways, please do it both ways.

#Plot the correlation matrix using seaborn.

#What are the most correlated features?

#Use the most appropriate plot to display the summary statistics of Age depending on Pclass.

#Use seaborn to plot the distribution of Age based on the Gender.
